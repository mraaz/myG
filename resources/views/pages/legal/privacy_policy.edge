<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">GENERAL</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">MJRAAZ, PTY, LTD, (&ldquo;Company&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo; or "myG") respects the privacy of its users (&ldquo;user&rdquo; or &ldquo;you&rdquo;) that use our companies website located at https://myG.gg, including other media forms, media channels, mobile website or mobile application related or connected thereto (collectively, the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">Users of myG, Generally</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&ldquo;Non-Personally-Identifying Information&rdquo; is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person. &ldquo;Personally-Identifying Information,&rdquo; by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person. Like most website operators, myG gathers from users of the Website Non-Personally Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the user&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible for Company to determine from an IP address a user&rsquo;s Internet service provider and the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">Privacy Policy (Rev. 133C579) 2 / 9</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">geographic location of the visitor&rsquo;s point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyses Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design the Website to improve users&rsquo; experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. From time to time, Company may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">Web Cookies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">A &ldquo;Web Cookie&rdquo; is a string of information which assigns you a unique identification that a website stores on a user&rsquo;s computer, and that the user&rsquo;s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep track of services you have used, to record registration information regarding your login name and password, to record your user preferences, to keep you logged into the Website and to facilitate purchase procedures. Company also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve users&rsquo; experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other NonPersonally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website, Company analyses and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used. COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">Third-Party Advertisers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Website. These companies may use information (not including any Personally-Identifying Information) about your visits to the Website and other websites that are contained in Web Cookies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Using a tool created by the Network Advertising Initiative, you can opt out of several third-party ad servers&rsquo; and networks&rsquo; Web Cookies simultaneously. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please follow the following links: http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/, or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Please contact us if you would like to know the identity of the thirdparty advertising companies we are currently using to serve ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">We may allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements, and we may use any of the Non-Personally Identifying Information we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. We do not identify you to the advertiser.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">Web Beacons</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">A &ldquo;Web Beacon&rdquo; is an object that is embedded in a web page or email that is usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">Privacy Policy (Rev. 133C579) 3 / 9</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">Company may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to access users&rsquo; Personally-Identifying Information. They are a technique Company may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">Analytics</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimise and serve ads based on your past activity on the Website, including Google Analytics for Display Advertising. The information collected may be used to, among other things, analyse and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. If you do not want any information to be collected and used by Google Analytics, you can install an opt-out in your web browser (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and/or opt out from Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network by using Google&rsquo;s Ads Settings (www.google.com/settings/ads).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">Mobile Device Additional Terms</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;"> Mobile Device. If you use a mobile device to access the Website or download any of our applications, we may collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model and manufacturer), operating system, version information and IP address.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;"> Geo-Location Information. Unless we have received your prior consent, we do not access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application or our services, except that it may be possible for Company to determine from an IP address the geographic location of your point of connectivity, in which case we may gather and use such general location data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;"> &nbsp; Push Notifications. We send you push notifications if you choose to receive them, letting you know when someone has sent you a message or for other service-related matters. If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device&rsquo;s settings.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">Privacy Policy (Rev. 133C579) 4 / 9</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;"> Mobile Analytics. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information, such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any Personally-Identifying Information you submit within the mobile application.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">SOCIAL MEDIA</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">We may provide you the option to connect your account on the Website to your account on some social networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or enabling certain features on the Website. When logging in using your social network credentials, we may collect the Personally-Identifying Information you have made publicly available on the social networking site, such as your name, profile picture, cover photo, username, gender, friends network, age range, locale, friend list and any other information you have made public. Once connected, other users may also be able to see information about your social network, such as the size of your network and your friends, including common friends. By connecting your account on the Website to your account on any social networking site, you hereby consent to the continuous release of information about you to us. We will not send any of your account information to the connected social networking site without first disclosing that to you. Each social network may further allow you to set privacy controls around your information on their system, and our collection of information will always follow such controls and permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the available features and shared information are subject to change without notice to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook&rsquo;s &ldquo;Like&rdquo; button, Twitter&rsquo;s &ldquo;tweet&rdquo; button or the Google+, that particular social network&rsquo;s plugin will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that provider&rsquo;s servers. If you do not use these buttons, none of your data will be sent to the respective social network&rsquo;s plugin provider. So for example, when you click on the Facebook&rsquo;s &ldquo;Like&rdquo; button on the Website, Facebook will receive your IP address, the browser version and screen resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access the Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the websites of these social networks and are not within our control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>

We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender, age, date of birth, username,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about the Personally-Identifying Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of the Personally-Identifying Information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared Personally-Identifying Information in the immediately preceding calendar year.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, the Website currently does not respond to DNT browser signals or mechanisms.</span></p>
