# Helpers

There are a few helpers in this folder, designed to be used within the DraftJS components, along with any implementing components.

## Functions

Functions within this folder general in the sense they don't / cannot go on the base draftjs component, but are not general enough to go in the primary Utilities file.

## Helpers

Constants are specific to the editors and dont make much sense elsewhere.
